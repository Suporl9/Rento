                <img class="terkimg" src="placestotravelf/mustang.jpg" alt="">
                <p class="trekp">Brought to the world stage by the Anthill Films crew in Strength In Numbers and again by Red Bull in Where The Trail Ends, this area is a biker’s mecca. Lower Mustang is accessible and there are so many great trails that you can custom make every trip - from about 5 days up to 10 days - and still be having fun.

                    Upper Mustang is very remote and is also a restricted area (making it expensive as you need a permit), but the extra cost is well worth it as you can visit the ancient fortress city of Lo Manthang and ride the dirt that the Red Bull crew searched all over the world for. Highlights - the scenery is truly spectacular, the culture is astounding and the trails are unforgettable.</p>

                <h1 class="trekh1">2. The Balaju – Kakani – Mahankal – Jarankhu trail</h1>
                <img class="terkimg" src="placestotravelf/NagarkotDownhillMountainBikingTrek.jpg" alt="">
                <p class="trekp">This is an easy tour that can take up to five hours depending on the cyclist’s speed. Balaju Chowk is a busy junction at the Nagarjuna foothills, north of Kathmandu’s Ring Road. From here you can cycle up to Balaju bypass where the tour begins. Follow the highway and head towards Trishuli. It’s even simpler and pleasant as you just continue on the main highway and avoid any misdirections. From Trishuli, you just need to follow the highway and not get off the main track until you reach a place called Ranipauwa. Here the route pitchforks into two different directions and you need to take the one on the right that leads to Kakani. This part of the route that might get steep and difficult for amateur cyclists. The same route brings you back to where you started.</p>

                <p class="trekp">What happens when the roads come into a trekker's paradise, bringing the villagers much needed access to markets, health care and education? Travellers can maximize their holiday time by getting farther away from the big centers in shorter times - ie, get to the fun faster!

                    You once needed 21 days to experience this stunning area, but now you can jeep and mountain bike in about 11 days (or take more time if you can, it’s worth it). Highlights - mind-blowing scenery, diverse cultures, some incredible trails (some hike a bike or porterage required), point-to-point journey.</p>

                <h1 class="trekh1">5.The Lakuri Bhanjyang trail</h1>
                <img src="placestotravelf/K-MTB_0090-1021x600.jpg" alt="Lakuri Bhanjyang" class="terkimg">
                <p class="trekp">This is a 30 km (18mile) long cycling trail from Patan to Lakuri Bhanjyang. The trail posits an intermediate level difficult, but is thoroughly enjoyable from the start. The route begins at the mountain town of Patan and curls towards Sundhara. A further 6 kilometers (2.8 miles) on, you will find the beautiful Lubhu city. Any tiredness is swept away as the snow-capped mountains and the Kathmandu valley appear in sight. Try not to be too distracted as the ascent can get a bit risky for some cyclists. The descent down the rural valley of Bebar Khola is a serene treat for your senses.</p>
